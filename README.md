# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to display the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth and to show all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4 on the map, as well as show how the data  on a third map style.

## Approach
To display all the necessary information, we used JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We also used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
